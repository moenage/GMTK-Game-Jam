# GMTK-Game-Jam
This was created for the GameMaker's Toolkit (GMTK) 2023 Game Jam with the theme of "Roles Reversed".

I solo-developed this game in 2 days with some feedback from a friend along the way. The game was built in Unity, C#, and Github. I utilized Unity's Prefab system to simplify the creation
and instantion of any game object. Moreover, the enemy spwaner is set to a timer that increases with difficulty as time goes. Using Unity's post processing capabilities, I was able to take
the game from looking like an unpolished mess to a juicy looking game! The game also had a power up to turn the player into the "Bullet-Hell" which is what fits the game into the rather
difficult theme. The game ranked in the top 15% for enjoyment out of 6500+ submissions!
